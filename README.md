# XBee Wireless Sensor Network - Busfire Detection & Prevention

Outlined in this github repo is the contents of the final assesment item for the Wireless Networks (8227) unit at the University of Canberra.

The following project aims to outline a continuously scalable bushfire monitoring system built on the XBeeÂ®-PRO 900HP S3/S3B product configured in a self-healing mesh network topology.

The network is designed to be highly scalable as well as extensible with a range of additional sensors based on individual monitoring needs. In addition, the network is backed by highly available cloud infrastructure allowing for real time data analysis and display.
